/**
 * The device sandbox's screen, as pixels — what `adb shell screencap` answers with.
 *
 * Neither of the obvious ways to read it works, and both were measured rather than assumed.
 * `screencap -d <id>` returns a 0-byte file for a display this app owns, which is what the retired
 * display-server work ran into. And `PixelCopy` over the tab's `SurfaceView` answers
 * `ERROR_SOURCE_NO_DATA` every time: the guest's pixels live in a `SurfaceControl` of its own that
 * the view only *parents*, so the buffer queue `PixelCopy` reads is one nothing was ever queued
 * into — while every non-SDK member of `SurfaceControlViewHost` that could reach the real layer is
 * denied outright.
 *
 * So the screen is asked of whoever is drawing it: the guest re-draws its own hierarchy, which is
 * exact for everything the view system draws. A surface the guest composites itself — a `VideoView`,
 * say — would come back empty, and there is no way from here to know it did.
 *
 * A device with no app on it is not an error: it answers the idle screen at the size the tab gives
 * the device — the same [VirtualWallpaper] the tab paints — so what a driver captures is what the
 * user is looking at.
