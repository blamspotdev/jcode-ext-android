 * A moving location and a shaking accelerometer are values that change tens of times a second, and

 * `:guest`, the live readout in the IDE. Sending the values would mean an IPC per sample, a policy
 * file rewritten at 50 Hz, and two readers that disagree whenever one is behind.
 *
 * So nothing is sent. The *description* is written once — "walk from here to there at 14 m/s,
 * starting at this clock reading" — and both sides work out where that puts the device now.
 * `elapsedRealtime` is the same number in every process, so the two answers are identical by
 * construction rather than by synchronisation, and a route that has been running for an hour costs
 * exactly what one that just started costs.
