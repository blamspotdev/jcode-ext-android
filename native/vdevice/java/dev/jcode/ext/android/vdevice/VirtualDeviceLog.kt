/**
 * The virtual device's own log — what `adb logcat` answers with, and the only way to see *why* a
 * guest died from outside the tab.
 *
 * It is not the phone's log, and it is not meant to be: `READ_LOGS` is `signature|privileged`, so
 * another app's entries are unreachable here and always will be. What it *is* is everything about
 * this device, from three sources that only together make it diagnosable:
 *
 *  1. The container's own account — what it loaded, what it bound, what it refused and why.
 *  2. The guest's `System.out` and `System.err` — see [captureStandardStreams].
 *  3. **The `:guest` process's own system log** — see [captureProcessLog], which is where an app's
 *     `android.util.Log` and native output live, and which the log daemon hands over unprivileged
 *     because a reader is scoped to its own uid rather than refused.
 *
 * The third one used to be missing, on the belief that an app can read nothing back from `logcat` at
 * all. That cost a whole investigation: a session in which the phone's document picker had opened
 * over the IDE and an app had been left waiting for a result for ever produced a device log of three
 * lines, while the system log for the same pid named the bug outright.
 *
 * **A file, deliberately.** The `:guest` process and the IDE both write it, and a full-screen guest
 * has no session bound to carry the lines over — but the two processes share a uid and a data
 * directory, so an appending write is all the coordination needed. `VirtualDeviceApps.resetOnStart`
 * wipes it with everything else, so the log covers exactly one JCode session.

     * The note that used to be here said an app can read nothing back from `logcat`, and it made the
     * device's log the container's hand-written narrative alone. That turns out to be half true and
     * the wrong half: `READ_LOGS` is indeed `signature|privileged`, but the log daemon scopes an
     * unprivileged reader **to its own uid** rather than refusing it — so a reader started here gets
     * `:guest`'s entries, and only those, with no permission at all.
     *
     * What that recovers is most of the log:
     *
     *  - the **guest's** own `android.util.Log` calls, which reach `logd` through a native call the
     *    container cannot stand in front of, and were therefore invisible;
     *  - its **native** logging — `__android_log_print` from an NDK app, which for a game engine is
     *    approximately all of its output;
     *  - the framework's own complaints on the guest's behalf, which is where a broken app usually
     *    says what is wrong;
     *  - and the container's ~60 `Log` calls, which were written to explain exactly the failures a
     *    driver is trying to diagnose and were going somewhere nobody could read.
     *
     * Measured on WaveRepo: the device's log held three lines for a session in which the phone's
     * document picker had opened over the IDE and an app had been left waiting for a result for ever.
     * The system log for the same pid held the GL context, the renderer, the audio stream, the app's
     * own "asking for the document picker", and the container's `outgoing startActivity: null` —
     * which names the bug outright.
     *
     * Filtered by **pid**, not uid: JCode's own process shares the uid, and the device's log is the
     * device's business. A platform that does refuse the reader costs one line saying so, which is
     * itself worth having in the log.
