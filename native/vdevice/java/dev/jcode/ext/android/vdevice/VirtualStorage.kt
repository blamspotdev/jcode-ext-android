/**
 * The virtual device's two storage volumes.
 *
 * A device with no filesystem is a device most apps cannot finish a sentence on. An app opens a
 * document, saves an export, unpacks its assets, writes a log; before this the container had nowhere
 * for any of that to go, so those calls either failed or — worse — landed in the **phone's** shared
 * storage, among the user's own files, under JCode's `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`. Measured on WaveRepo:
 * asking for a SoundFont opened the phone's own document picker over the IDE, listing the user's
 * downloads and screenshots to an app that is supposed to be sandboxed.
 *
 * There are two volumes because the device needs storage for two different lifetimes, and one volume
 * cannot have both.
 *
 * | | [Internal] | [External] |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | Device path | `/sdcard` | `/storage/external` |
 * | Lives in | `filesDir/vdevice/storage` | the workspace, as `vDevice_ExtStorage` |
 * | Survives a JCode restart | **no** | yes |
 * | Visible in the IDE | no | yes, beside your projects |
 *
 * **Internal is the clean room.** It is emptied on every JCode start along with the installed apps,
 * for the reason they are: a file that outlived the app that wrote it would be waiting to be found
 * by whatever was installed under that package name next. [seed] puts the empty media directories
 * back afterwards, so the device starts as a formatted phone does rather than as a bare directory.
 *
 * **External is the way out.** A photo the device took, a file an app exported, a log it wrote — on
 * a clean-room device those are gone the next time JCode starts, which is right for a sandbox and
 * useless for the thing a sandbox is for. This volume is an ordinary folder in the workspace, so
 * what an app writes there is still there tomorrow, is visible in the project explorer, is editable
 * in the IDE, and is reachable from the Linux environment at `/workspace/vDevice_ExtStorage`. It is
 * the seam between the device and the work.
 *
 * Both are presented to apps the way a phone presents two volumes: `getExternalFilesDirs` and its
 * siblings answer with **two** entries, internal first, which is exactly the shape an app written
 * for a phone with an SD card already handles.
 *
 * ### Known gap
 *
 * `Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()` still answers the **phone's** path. It is computed
 * fresh inside `Environment.UserEnvironment.getExternalDirs()` on every call, out of
 * `StorageManager.getVolumeList`, so there is no cached field to redirect and no method to override
 * without standing in front of the storage service for the whole process. Everything reached through
 * a `Context` — which is what an app targeting API 30 or later has to use — is redirected here; an
 * app that reaches for the static instead sees the phone.
