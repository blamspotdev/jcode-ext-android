/**
 * Gives the guest process a distinct device identity.
 *
 * The design goal is *different identity, same hardware*: only the descriptive `Build` strings are
 * rewritten. Anything hardware-derived — CPU count, memory, display metrics, ABI list — is left
 * alone, so a guest still measures the machine it is really running on.
 *
 * `Build`'s fields are `static final`, so this is process-wide and irreversible; [apply] therefore
 * refuses to run anywhere but the `:guest` process, where nothing of JCode's own runs.
