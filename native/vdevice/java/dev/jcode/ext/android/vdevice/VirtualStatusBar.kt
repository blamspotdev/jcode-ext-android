/**
 * The virtual device's status bar and notification shade.
 *
 * **No clock and no battery, on purpose.** Those belong to the phone, and the phone's own status bar
 * is right above this one — a second copy would be either a lie or a duplicate. What this carries is
 * what the phone's bar *cannot* say: what the app inside has posted, and what the device's own
 * radios are doing. Wi-Fi is the clearest case of the difference — the icon up here is the device's
 * Wi-Fi, which the shade can switch off while the phone stays online, and which is the whole reason
 * an app can be taken offline without disconnecting the machine being worked on.
 *
 * ### The shade
 *
 * Quick actions above notifications, as on a phone: one tile per radio the device was built with,
 * switching it on and off where the app is rather than three screens away in Settings. And it can be
 * pulled from anywhere — over a dialog, over a popup, over an app that has taken the whole screen —
 * because a shade that only works on some screens is not the device's shade. See
 * [EmbeddedGuest.deviceUiUnder] for how it wins a touch from a guest's own window, and [immersive]
 * for what is left to pull when the strip itself is not drawn.
 *
 * ### Why it lives in the guest's hierarchy
 *
 * It is added to [EmbeddedGuest]'s container, above the guest's decor view, rather than composed
 * over the tab by the IDE. That single decision is what makes it behave like part of the device
 * rather than part of JCode:
 *
 * | | Falls out of being a child of the container |
 * |---|---|
 * | `screencap` shows it | `EmbeddedGuest.capture` draws the container |
 * | `uiautomator dump` lists it | `EmbeddedGuest.dump` walks the container, and these are real views with real text |
 * | A finger and `input tap` reach it | Both arrive through `EmbeddedGuest.touch`, which dispatches into the container |
 *
 * The same property the launcher has, for the same reason: what an agent screenshots is where its
 * taps land. The IDE's own affordances — the control bar and its pill — stay composed over the
 * surface and stay out of captures, which is what keeps the two tellable apart.

     * **Where it stops, measured.** A button whose intent names one of the guest's *own* components

     * real activity manager rather than calling anything this process can stand in front of — traced
     * across a tap, a wrapped `IIntentSender` sees `asBinder` and never `send` — and the intent
     * inside it cannot be recovered either, because `PendingIntent.mTarget` is **blocked** at
     * `targetSdk` 33 (`NoSuchFieldException: No field mTarget`). So the component goes out to a
     * system that has never heard of the package, resolves to nothing, and reports no error.
     *
     * A button aimed anywhere the real system can reach works normally. What is lost is an app's
     * buttons on its own screens, which for a media player is its transport controls — the app's own
     * UI still has them. A cancelled intent is the app having moved on, not an error worth showing.
