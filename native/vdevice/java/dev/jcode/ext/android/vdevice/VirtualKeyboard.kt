/**
 * The device's keyboard: when it appears, what field it is typing into, and where it sits.
 *
 * The keys themselves belong to [KeyboardApp], which is an ordinary guest. This is the part a phone
 * calls the input-method *manager* — the half that watches for a field taking the focus, asks that
 * field for an `InputConnection`, and puts the keyboard on the screen over the app.
 *
 * ### Why the container has to do the watching
 *
 * A guest's views live in a windowless [android.view.SurfaceControlViewHost] hierarchy, and the
 * platform's IME machinery starts at a *window* gaining focus. There is no window here to gain any,
 * so `InputMethodManager.showSoftInput` from inside a guest returns false before it reaches a
 * binder: the view is not "served", because nothing ever served it. That is what left the device
 * borrowing the phone's keyboard, which is JCode's chrome — invisible to `screencap`, absent from
 * `uiautomator dump`, and unreachable by `input tap`.
 *
 * What the platform is really watching for is public and observable from here: a view that answers
 * [View.onCheckIsTextEditor] taking the focus, and [View.onCreateInputConnection] to talk to it.
 * `TextView` builds that connection itself, with no IME session involved — so the container asks the
 * same two questions the framework would and gets the same object a real keyboard is handed.
 *
 * ### What falls out of the keyboard being a child of the guest's container
 *
 * | | Because |
 * |---|---|
 * | `screencap` shows it | [EmbeddedGuest.capture] draws the container |
 * | `uiautomator dump` lists every key | [EmbeddedGuest.dump] walks it, and the keys are real views |
 * | `input tap` presses a key | Taps arrive through [EmbeddedGuest.touch], which dispatches into it |
 *
 * The same property [VirtualStatusBar] has, for the same reason: what an agent screenshots is where
 * its taps land.
