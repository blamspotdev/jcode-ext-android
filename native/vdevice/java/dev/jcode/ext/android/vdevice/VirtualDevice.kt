 * Runs a built APK inside JCode — no install, no ADB, no root.
 *
 * The guest is loaded into a **separate process of this app** (`:guest`, declared on the stub
 * activities in `AndroidManifest.xml`) so it gets its own ART heap and its own framework hooks and
 * cannot corrupt the IDE. Inside that process the container loads the APK's dex, resources and
 * native libraries by hand and persuades `ActivityThread` to instantiate the guest's activities in
 * place of JCode's stubs, so the *system* still drives attach and the whole activity lifecycle.
 *
 * The guest therefore shares JCode's uid, its permissions and its process — this is a **sandboxed
 * preview, not a security boundary**.
 *
 * [launch] is the full-screen path: a real activity, in its own task, with everything a real window
 * brings. The device-sandbox editor tab is the other one — see [EmbeddedGuest] — and it exists because
 * the container instantiates the guest activity itself and so does not have to ask the system for a
 * window at all. Putting a *system-launched* activity on a display we own stays impossible for a
 * normal app: `ActivityOptions.setLaunchDisplayId` requires the signature|privileged
 * `ACTIVITY_EMBEDDING` permission.
