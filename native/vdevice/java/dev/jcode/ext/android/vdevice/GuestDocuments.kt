/**
 * Turns the device Files app's answer into the URI the requesting app is waiting for.
 *
 * ### What this used to be, and why it is smaller now
 *
 * A guest's `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` used to leave the device: the **phone's** picker opened over
 * JCode, offering a sandboxed app the user's downloads and photos, and then the answer went nowhere
 * because an embedded activity's token is one no `ActivityRecord` responds to. The first fix was for
 * the container to take the launch off the wire and draw a picker itself.
 *
 * That worked and was still the wrong shape. A drawn screen is not something `PackageManager` can
 * find, so an app calling `resolveActivity` before it offers an "attach a file" button found
 * nothing and offered nothing — and the device's storage had no app of its own to look at it with.
 * The picker is now the device's **Files app**: an ordinary guest, started by ordinary intent
 * resolution ([DeviceIntents]), answering through the ordinary result path ([GuestResults]).
 *
 * What is left here is the one part an app is not qualified to do for itself.
 *
 * ### The translation
 *
 * The Files app answers with a **device path**, under [DeviceIntents.EXTRA_DEVICE_PATH]. The
 * requester needs a `content://` URI into [VirtualStorageProvider], whose authority and document-id
 * encoding are the container's business — an app that built one itself would be coupled to a format
 * it cannot see change, and a picker that shipped separately would be coupled to a format it cannot
 * see at all. So the picker says which file was chosen, and this says what that file is called on
 * the wire.
