/**
 * The running guest's view tree, in the shape `uiautomator dump` answers with.
 *
 * This is the device's answer to "what is on the screen?" for something that cannot look at it. A
 * screenshot says where things are but not what they are; this says both, so an agent driving the
 * device over adb can find a button by its resource id and tap its centre instead of guessing
 * coordinates out of a PNG.
 *
 * Real `uiautomator` reads an accessibility node tree from outside the app. There is no such tree to
 * read here — the embedded hierarchy is registered with no accessibility connection — but the
 * container is *inside* the process holding the views, so it walks them directly. The attribute set
 * is uiautomator's, in uiautomator's order, so a parser written for one reads the other.
 *
 * Only what is drawn is listed: an invisible or gone subtree is skipped whole, the same way the real
 * dump skips what the accessibility layer never reports.
