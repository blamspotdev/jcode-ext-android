 * ### Why a file rather than preferences
 *
 * Two processes disagree about `SharedPreferences`. The launcher that writes this lives in the IDE
 * and the container that acts on it lives in `:guest`, and a preferences file is cached in memory
 * per process from the moment it is first read — so `:guest` would keep answering with whatever the
 * policy said when the guest started, and a permission the user revoked while an app was on the
 * screen would go on being granted until the process died. `MODE_MULTI_PROCESS` has been deprecated
 * and unreliable since API 11, so there is nothing to turn on.
 *
 * A plain properties file, written atomically and re-read whenever its timestamp moves, has none of
 * that ambiguity: the writer renames a complete file into place, and the reader notices. It is a
 * handful of lines of state — this is not a store worth building anything cleverer for.
 *
 * ### Why it does not survive a restart
 *
 * It lives inside `filesDir/vdevice/`, so [VirtualDeviceApps.resetOnStart] takes it with everything
 * else. That is deliberate rather than incidental: the device is wiped on every start, and a grant
 * that outlived the app it was granted to would be a permission attached to nothing, waiting to
 * apply itself to whatever was installed under that package name next.
