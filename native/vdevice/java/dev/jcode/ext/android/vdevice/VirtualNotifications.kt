/**
 * What the virtual device has been told to show in its status bar.
 *
 * A guest's notifications cannot go to the real one, and the reason is worth stating plainly: every
 * binder call a guest makes goes out under **JCode's** uid and package, so a guest that posts a
 * notification would put it in the user's own shade, attributed to JCode, and leave it there after
 * the device was emptied. The point of the virtual device is that an app can be tried without
 * touching the phone, and the notification shade is part of the phone.
 *
 * So [GuestNotificationHook] answers the guest's notification manager here instead, and the device
 * grows a status bar of its own to show the result — see [VirtualStatusBar].
 *
 * Lives in `:guest` and dies with it, which is the same lifetime the device's screen has: stopping
 * an app takes its process, and a stopped app's notifications with it.
