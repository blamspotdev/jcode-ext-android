/**
 * The virtual device's own adb **daemon**: the device end of the adb transport protocol, so the
 * device shows up in `adb devices` and can be installed to like any other target.
 *
 * It is the pack's, like everything else the device is. JCode contributes the wire format and the
 * key store -- [AdbWire], [AdbAuth] -- because its own bridge to a *real* phone speaks the same
 * protocol, and one implementation of a binary protocol is enough for both.
 *
 * It represents the virtual device and nothing else. It never touches the host phone's adbd, needs no
 * Developer Options, and holds no privilege beyond JCode's own — everything it exposes is served by
 * the [AdbServiceHandler] it is given.
 *
 * **Why it is a Unix socket and not a port.** This daemon exposes `exec:cmd package install` — "run
 * this APK inside JCode" — which is arbitrary code execution with JCode's uid and permissions. On
 * Android every app shares one loopback interface, so a listener on `127.0.0.1:<port>` is reachable
 * by *every other app on the phone*; the only thing standing between them and that service was adb's
 * AUTH exchange. A socket bound in JCode's own storage cannot be reached at all by a process that
 * cannot open the file, which is every uid but JCode's — so the proot distro, which runs under that
 * uid, still reaches it and nothing else does.
 *
 * Authentication against [authorizedKeys] stays exactly as it was. It is now the second line rather
 * than the only one — see [AdbAuth] for what it means here.
 *
 * The client end is `adb connect localfilesystem:<path>`, which adb supports on Linux (and refuses on
 * Windows, where AF_UNIX sockets are not available to it). The transport's serial is then that spec
 * rather than an address, so the device shows up as itself and there is no port to scan for.
 *
 * [banner] is adb's connection banner *without* its terminating NUL, e.g.
 * `device::ro.product.name=…;features=cmd,…`. The `cmd` feature is load-bearing: with it `adb install`
 * opens a single `exec:cmd package 'install' -S <n>` stream; without it the client falls back to
 * `push` + `pm install` and needs the whole `sync:` service.
