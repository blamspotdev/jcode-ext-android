/**
 * Lets a guest build a `PendingIntent`.
 *
 * `PendingIntent` is the one place a guest's *name* is checked rather than merely reported. Creating
 * one goes to `IActivityManager.getIntentSender(…, packageName, …)`, and the activity manager
 * verifies that the package belongs to the calling uid before it will mint one:
 *
 * ```
 * java.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: getIntentSender() from pid=26873, uid=10211,
 *     (need uid=-1) is not allowed to send as package org.zwanoo.android.speedtest
 * ```
 *
 * Everywhere else [GuestContext] answers with the guest's identity, which is the whole point of it.
 * Here that is exactly what fails, so this is the one call where the **host's** package has to go
 * out instead — the case the security notes describe as `packageName must match the calling uid`.
 *
 * The substitution costs the guest nothing it could otherwise have had. A `PendingIntent` is a token
 * the system hands to somebody else to act on the app's behalf, and a guest is not a package the
 * system can act on behalf of in the first place; what it gets back is a working token owned by
 * JCode, which is the identity every other binder call it makes already goes out under.
 *
 * Scoped to `getIntentSender` on purpose. Rewriting the package on every call would be a much
 * larger claim about what a guest is allowed to do under JCode's name, and only this one was
 * measured to need it.
