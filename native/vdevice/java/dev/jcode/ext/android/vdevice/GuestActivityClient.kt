/**
 * Answers the activity manager's token-keyed questions for an *embedded* guest activity.
 *
 * An embedded activity is built by hand, so its token is a bare [android.os.Binder] rather than
 * something the window manager minted. Everything the framework routes through `ActivityClient`
 * carries that token, and the server rejects it before doing anything:
 *
 * ```
 * Bad activity token: android.os.BinderProxy@5fb1255
 * java.lang.ClassCastException: android.os.BinderProxy cannot be cast to
 *     com.android.server.wm.ActivityRecord$Token
 *     at com.android.server.wm.ActivityRecord.getTaskForActivityLocked
 * ```
 *
 * Measured on CPU-Z, whose Mobile Ads SDK asks for its task from inside a WebView and took the whole
 * guest down with a native `SIGTRAP` when the answer never came.
 *
 * `IActivityClientController` is an **interface**, which is what makes this tractable: one [Proxy]
 * sits underneath every entry point. Calls carrying a token this container minted are answered here;
 * every other call — including a full-screen guest's, whose token *is* real — goes straight through
 * untouched.
 *
 * ### Where the proxy gets in
 *
 * Not by replacing `ActivityClient`'s own singleton: `ActivityClient.INTERFACE_SINGLETON` is
 * **blocked** at `targetSdk` 33, measured on this device —
 * `Accessing hidden field …ActivityClient;->INTERFACE_SINGLETON (blocked, reflection, denied)`.
 *
 * It gets in one level up instead. That singleton builds its controller by calling
 * `IActivityTaskManager.getActivityClientController()`, and [GuestHooks.installStartActivityHook]
 * already proxies *that* binder through a member which is greylisted and allowed. So the container
 * answers the question with [wrap] and the singleton caches the wrapper as though the server had
 * handed it over — no additional hidden member, and the one it depends on is already load-bearing.
 *
 * This is why the hook has to be installed before anything in `:guest` touches an activity: the
 * singleton asks once and keeps the answer.
 *
 * ### Why an unknown method is swallowed rather than forwarded
 *
 * The alternative to a made-up answer is not a correct answer, it is the exception above. So a
 * method this does not model returns a type-appropriate nothing: `false`, `0`, or null. That turns
 * a class of hard failures into no-ops, which is the difference between an app that runs with one
 * feature inert and an app that does not run.

     * The value is what makes `getCallingPackage()` answerable. On a phone the server knows who
     * launched an activity because it recorded the launch; here the server has never heard of either
     * party, so the container has to remember it at the one moment it knows — when it mints the
     * token — or the device's own Camera and Files are reduced to saying "An app wants a photo",
     * which is the one thing a person needs those screens to tell them.
