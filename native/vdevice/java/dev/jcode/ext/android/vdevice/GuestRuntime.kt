 * A guest activity belongs to a package the system has never heard of, so there is no `ActivityInfo`
 * to build one from. JCode's `GuestActivity` stub is that template and nothing more: an intent naming it carries

 * [newActivity] instantiates that class out of the guest's class loader, and [bind] hands the

 *
 * [embed] does that without the system: it builds the activity here so the device-sandbox

     * Puts [stub] on the device's screen, from whichever thread the app started it on.
     *
     * ### Why the thread matters
     *
     * Hosting builds an activity and adds its decor view to the tab's container, and a view
     * hierarchy may only be touched by the thread that created it. `startActivity` has no such rule:
     * it is a binder call, and the platform is free to be called from anywhere — so an app that asks
     * for a picker from a worker is doing nothing wrong. A game does it as a matter of course,
     * because its `android_main` thread owns the state the answer belongs to and JNI is how it
     * reaches Java at all.
     *
     * Measured on WaveRepo, whose native thread asked for `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`: the device
     * resolved its own Files app, tried to host it on the calling thread, threw inside `addView`,
     * and answered the app that there was no picker on this device —
     * `ActivityNotFoundException: No Activity found to handle Intent { act=…OPEN_DOCUMENT }` — while
     * the same intent from a button worked, because a button is a main-thread event. Every one of
     * the device's apps was unreachable to that app for the same reason: its camera, its browser,
     * its settings, its picker.
     *
     * So a launch from anywhere else is posted to the main looper and answered [StartAction.Consumed]
     * before it has happened. That is not optimism — it is what the platform's own answer means. A
     * real `startActivity` returns as soon as the server has *accepted* the launch, and the activity
     * appears afterwards; the container is making the same promise, and [failed] is what keeps it
     * honest when it cannot be met.
