/**
 * What JCode's virtual device shows when nothing is running on it.
 *
 * A device with its screen on and no app on it should look like a device, not like a failure, so the
 * idle screen is a wallpaper rather than the black a dead surface gives back. Three outlined
 * shapes — a square, a triangle and a circle — over dark grey: unmistakably a placeholder, quiet
 * enough to put a launcher on top of, and drawn thin so the app icons stay the brightest thing on
 * the screen.
 *
 * It is drawn rather than shipped as a drawable because the same picture has to reach two places
 * that cannot share one: the tab paints it onto the `SurfaceView`'s own surface (nothing composed
 * *behind* a SurfaceView is ever visible — it punches a hole in the window), and [VirtualScreen]
 * paints it into a bitmap so `adb shell screencap` answers with the screen the user is looking at.
 *
 * The composition is deterministic and laid out in fractions of the screen, so it scales to any tab
 * size and two captures of an idle device compare equal.

     * [VirtualPalette.SURFACE] rather than [VirtualPalette.BACKGROUND], and the step up is the
     * point: the status bar *is* the ground colour at 80%, so a wallpaper painted the ground too
     * would have the bar disappear into the home screen behind it. The wallpaper is the thing the
     * bar sits on, so it is one tone above it.
