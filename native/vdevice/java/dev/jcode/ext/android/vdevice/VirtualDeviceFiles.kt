/**
 * Where everything the virtual device forgets lives.
 *
 * The device's apps, their data, its internal storage, its policy, its log, its last screenshot —
 * all of it is emptied on every JCode start, by design, because a device that remembered would be
 * one where a file outlived the app that wrote it and waited to be found by whatever was installed
 * under that package name next.
 *
 * ### Why `cacheDir` and not `filesDir`
 *
 * Because that is what this data **is**. `filesDir` is for things an app would be sorry to lose;
 * `cacheDir` is for things it can rebuild, and the platform is entitled to reclaim it under storage
 * pressure or when somebody taps **Clear cache**. Every one of those is already true here — the tree
 * is deleted on the next start regardless — so keeping it in `filesDir` was claiming a durability
 * the device does not have and does not want. Moving it makes the phone's own storage screen tell
 * the truth about JCode: this is cache, it is safe to clear, and clearing it costs a session of a
 * sandbox rather than any of the user's work.
 *
 * The one thing that is **not** here is the device's external volume, which lives in the workspace
 * and is meant to survive — see [VirtualStorage].
 *
 * ### It can go away underneath us
 *
 * That is the trade, and it is handled rather than hoped about: the platform can clear a cache while
 * the app is running. Every directory here is created on demand, and [VirtualDeviceApps.apk]
 * reinstalls a built-in whose APK has vanished, so a cache cleared mid-session leaves a device that
 * is *empty* rather than one that is broken — which is the same state it is in every morning.
 *
 * ### One place that says where
 *
 * Six files used to compute `filesDir/vdevice/…` for themselves. That is not a tidiness point: it
 * meant a change of mind about where the device lives had six places to be right, and a wipe that
 * missed one would leave a device that was half its previous self.
