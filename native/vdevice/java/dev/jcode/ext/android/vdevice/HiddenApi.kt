/**
 * Reflection helpers for the framework internals the container is built on.
 *
 * Everything the virtual device does — swapping `ActivityThread.mInstrumentation`, reading
 * `ActivityThread.mH`, building a bare `AssetManager`, replacing the `IActivityTaskManager` binder
 * proxy — lives on non-SDK ("hidden") members, so **this is coupled to `targetSdk`.**
 *
 * Verified on Android 13 with JCode's `targetSdk = 33`: the members the full-screen path touches
 * are all on the `unsupported` greylist, which carries no `maxTargetSdk`, so they are *allowed* (the
 * runtime logs a warning per access and nothing more). Measured on this device, and added to that
 * list: `ActivityThread.sPackageManager` and `ApplicationPackageManager.mPM` are both readable and
 * writable at `targetSdk` 33, which is what lets [GuestPackageHook] answer a guest's questions about
 * its own package. The following are not allowed, and each is designed around rather than bypassed:
 *
 *  - `ContextThemeWrapper.mTheme` is `max-target-p`, so it cannot be cleared — see
 *    [GuestRuntime.onLaunchActivity], which keeps it from ever being created.
 *  - `ActivityThread.startActivityNow` does not appear in its class's declared members at all, which
 *    is what a *denied* member looks like from here. The device-sandbox tab uses the public
 *    `Instrumentation.newActivity` instead.
 *  - **Every** non-SDK member of `SurfaceControlViewHost` is denied, its `SurfacePackage` included:
 *    the class carries no `@UnsupportedAppUsage` at all. [EmbeddedWindows] therefore reaches the
 *    host's view root through the container's `getParent()` and its root layer through the
 *    `SurfacePackage`'s own `Parcelable` contract, both public.
 *  - **Every** member of `android.app.PropertyInvalidatedCache` is denied: the class reports no
 *    declared method and no declared field at all. That is the cache `ApplicationPackageManager`
 *    keeps in front of `hasSystemFeature`, so a guest's answer about what hardware the device has is
 *    frozen for the life of the process and there is nothing here that can clear it — see
 *    [AppSandbox.restartForHardware], which restarts the device instead.
 *  - `Activity.performStart`/`performResume` are denied the same way, and so is
 *    `Activity.mActivityLifecycleCallbacks` — the list those two dispatch to, and the one AndroidX's
 *    `ReportFragment` registers on. `Application.mActivityLifecycleCallbacks` *is* greylisted, so
 *    [GuestRuntime.resumeEmbedded] dispatches that one and drives the guest's own `LifecycleRegistry`
 *    for what the other would have reached.
 *
 * **Nothing here bypasses the restriction, and one attempt was made and abandoned.**
 * `VMRuntime.setHiddenApiExemptions` is the runtime's own switch for this, and reaching it by double
 * reflection — invoking `Class.forName` and `Class.getDeclaredMethod` reflectively, so the caller the
 * runtime sees is `java.lang.reflect.Method` on the boot classpath — is the usual escape hatch. It was
 * written, run and measured on Android 13: **denied**, as the method is itself blocklisted. So if a
 * future platform demotes any of the greylisted members above, the fix is a real one (a different
 * hook point), not a bypass.
 *
 * What *does* lift it is the platform's own developer setting, which is the device's to give and not
 * this app's to take: `adb shell settings put global hidden_api_policy 1`. With that set, measured on
 * the same device, `Activity.mActivityLifecycleCallbacks` becomes readable and a guest's own
 * activity-scoped callbacks receive the full sequence — `onActivityPostStarted`,
 * `onActivityPostResumed` and `onActivityPreStopped` included. The tab's caveat names that command,
 * because a warning nobody can act on is one that teaches people to ignore the icon behind it.
 *
 * None of this runs in the IDE process; the container only ever loads in `:guest`.
