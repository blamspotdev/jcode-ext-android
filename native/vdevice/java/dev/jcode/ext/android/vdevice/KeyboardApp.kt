/**
 * The device's keyboard app, loaded and asked for its keys.
 *
 * The keyboard is an ordinary guest — `tools/vdevice-keyboard`, bundled like the Camera and Files
 * apps — and it stays one. It is not put on the embedded back stack, because the one thing a
 * keyboard must never do is what starting an activity would do: pause the app being typed into. So
 * the container loads it, asks it for a `View`, and hosts that over whatever is running, the way a
 * phone hosts an IME's window over the app it is serving.
 *
 * ### What crosses between the two
 *
 * Nothing but framework types, and that is not a style choice. A guest's class loader is parented to
 * the **boot** loader rather than to JCode's (see [GuestLoader]), so a type declared in either place
 * is a different class on the other side. `Context`, `Handler`, `View`, `InputConnection` and
 * `EditorInfo` are all loaded by the boot loader, so they are the same class in both — which is
 * exactly the set this contract is written in.
 *
 * That constraint turns out to be the design rather than a tax on it. `InputConnection` is the
 * platform's own editing contract, the object a `TextView` hands a real IME, so the container has no
 * protocol to invent: it passes the focused field's connection straight through and the keyboard
 * edits with it exactly as any IME would. Text arrives as text — accents, emoji and all — instead of
 * being squeezed through `KeyCharacterMap`, which has no key for most of it.
 *
 * The reverse direction is a [Handler], because `Message` is a framework type and an interface would
 * not be: [MSG_HIDE] for the keyboard's own hide key, and [MSG_KEY] carrying a key code in `arg1`
 * for the one case an `InputConnection` cannot express — Enter on a single-line field that asked for
 * no editor action, which on a phone is delivered as a key.
 *
 * Every reflective step is guarded and [load] answers null rather than throwing: a device whose
 * keyboard APK is missing or too old should be a device with no keyboard, not a device that cannot
 * run an app.
