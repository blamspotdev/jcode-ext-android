 * What one app installed on the virtual device may do.

 * The list is the app's **own manifest** — every `<uses-permission>` it declares, and nothing else,

 * here decided. Each gets the three states a phone has, and they mean the same things.
 *
 * This is only half of the answer. It says what the *app* may do; the hardware bench says what the
 * *device* has, and both are required — an app cannot be given a camera the device does not have.
 * The two are deliberately separate: one is about trust, the other about equipment.
 *
 * Over the device's screen rather than on it, like [InstallSheet] and for the same reason: it is
 * JCode talking about the app, so it must not appear in what `screencap` answers with, where it
 * would read as something the guest drew.
