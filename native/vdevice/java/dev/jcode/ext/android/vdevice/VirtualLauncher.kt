/**
 * The virtual device's home screen, drawn onto the device's own screen rather than composed over it.
 *
 * This is the whole point of the class. The launcher used to be Compose laid over the `SurfaceView`,
 * which meant `adb shell screencap` answered a bare wallpaper: an agent could not see what was
 * installed, and could not tell an empty device from an app that had not drawn yet. Worse, drawing
 * it a second time for the capture would put the icons an agent *sees* in one place and the taps it
 * sends in another, since the two layouts would drift.
 *
 * So there is one layout ([tiles]) and one renderer ([draw]), and both the tab's surface and
 * [VirtualScreen]'s capture go through them. What the agent screenshots is, by construction, where
 * `input tap` lands — [hit] resolves a touch against the same rectangles.
 *
 * The consequence worth stating: only what belongs to the *device* is drawn here. JCode's own
 * "Install an app" button floats over the screen as IDE chrome and is deliberately absent from a
 * capture, the same way the tab's control bar is.
 *
 * Sizes are in dp against the display's density and never in sp: the device's screen must not
 * re-flow because the phone's font-scale setting changed, or two captures of one screen would
 * differ.
