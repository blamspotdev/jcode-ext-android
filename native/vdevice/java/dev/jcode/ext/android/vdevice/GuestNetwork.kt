/**
 * What the device says when a guest asks whether it is online, or whether Bluetooth is on.
 *
 * Left alone, both questions are answered by the **phone**: its Wi-Fi, its connection, its radio.
 * That is wrong in the ordinary way everything else in this container was wrong before it was fixed
 * — the device is supposed to be a device — and it is wrong in a way that costs something concrete.
 * *An app that has never been run without a network is an app whose offline path has never been
 * run*, and a developer cannot get an app into that state from here without turning the phone's own
 * Wi-Fi off, which also disconnects the IDE they are working in.
 *
 * ### The seam, and why it is a different one from the camera's
 *
 * [HiddenSeams] measures both. `ICameraService.Stub.asInterface` is **denied** at `targetSdk` 33, so
 * nothing can be put in front of the camera service. `IConnectivityManager`, `IWifiManager` and
 * `IBluetooth` all answer `asInterface=true`, which is the same seam [GuestLocation] goes through:
 * replace the entry in `ServiceManager`'s cache before anything reads it, and every manager built
 * afterwards is built on top of the replacement.
 *
 * ### Everything not answered here is passed through
 *
 * The proxies are **delegating**: a method this device has an opinion about is answered, and every
 * other one goes to the real binder untouched. That is the same shape as [GuestPackageHook] and it
 * is what makes this safe to install at all — `ConnectivityManager` has upwards of a hundred binder
 * methods, most of them things no guest asks and none of them things this container understands, and
 * a proxy that tried to be a complete implementation would be a much larger promise than the one
 * being made. The promise being made is: *the answers about this device are the device's.*
 *
 * ### `WifiManager` is not replaced either, and for a sharper reason
 *
 * It was, and it worked, and then it did not: `getSystemService(WIFI_SERVICE)` came back **null**.
 * `WifiManager`'s construction calls more of `IWifiManager` than a proxy built from the three
 * methods reflection exposes can answer, so the manager sometimes failed to build at all — and an
 * app that assumes `getSystemService` is non-null, which is nearly all of them, crashes on that.
 * A wrong answer to "is Wi-Fi on" is a much smaller failure than no manager, so the question is left
 * to the phone and the one that matters — *am I online* — is answered by `ConnectivityManager`,
 * which does work.
 *
 * ### Bluetooth is **not** stood in for
 *
 * The seam looked open. `BluetoothAdapter` is `final` and so cannot be substituted, but its
 * `mService` field is reachable and `IBluetooth.Stub.asInterface` is not blocked — which is the
 * shape that works for connectivity. Both directions were built and measured, and neither works:
 *
 * - **Clearing `mService`** left `isEnabled()` answering **true** with the phone's radio on.
 * - **Wrapping it** in a proxy answering `getState` never saw the call. `IBluetooth`'s visible
 *   method set on Android 13 is `asBinder, fetchRemoteUuids, getAddress, getConnectionState,
 *   getDeviceType, getRemoteAlias, getSocketOpt, getTwsPlusPeerAddress, isBroadcastActive,
 *   isTwsPlusDevice, setBondingInitiatedLocally, setSocketOpt, updateQuietModeStatus` — and
 *   `getState` is not in it, so `Proxy` does not implement it and the adapter's own call lands
 *   somewhere else entirely (it comes back as a wrapped `TimeoutException`).
 *
 * So the adapter's state does not travel through anything this container can reach. What the
 * device *can* govern is the part that goes through the package manager: whether it declares
 * `FEATURE_BLUETOOTH` at all, and whether an app is allowed `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` and
 * `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`. That is [VirtualHardware.Bluetooth], and it is real — it is just less than
 * the label suggests, which is why the label says so.
