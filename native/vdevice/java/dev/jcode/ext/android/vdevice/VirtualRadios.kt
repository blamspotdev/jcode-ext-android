/**
 * What the device's radios have around them.
 *
 * A simulated radio with nothing in range is a switch and a label. Turning Wi-Fi on gave a device
 * that was *on the network* and could not say what it was on, which reads as a screen that has not
 * been finished — there is nowhere for "which network am I on" to come from, no list to look at, and
 * nothing that changes when the switch does.
 *
 * So the device has surroundings: a handful of networks with names, signal strengths and locks, and
 * a few Bluetooth things in range. They are **generated once and kept**, in the policy file, which
 * puts them in the volatile tree — a new set of neighbours every time JCode starts, the same set for
 * as long as that device lives, and a `Scan again` that draws new ones on purpose. Generating them
 * on every read would be a list that reshuffled while somebody looked at it.
 *
 * ### What an app on the device sees
 *
 * **Nothing, and that is not this file's doing.** `WifiManager` could not be stood in for — measured,
 * and written up in the spec — so a guest's scan goes to the phone's manager, and JCode holds no
 * location permission, which is what `getScanResults` requires: it answers with an empty list, and
 * `getConnectionInfo().getSSID()` answers `<unknown ssid>`. A guest therefore learns neither these
 * names nor the real ones, which is the right end state for the real ones. These exist for the
 * device's own screens — its Settings app and the bench — the same way the camera's scene does.
