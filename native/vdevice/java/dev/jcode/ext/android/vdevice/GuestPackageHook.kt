/**
 * Makes the framework's own `PackageManager` able to answer questions about a guest.
 *
 * A guest asks the package manager about *itself* far more often than it looks. `androidx.startup`
 * reads its `InitializationProvider`'s `<meta-data>` through `getProviderInfo` — and so, transitively,
 * do WorkManager, Firebase, `emoji2` and ProfileInstaller, none of which start if that call fails.
 * AppCompat looks its own activity up through `getActivityInfo`. Analytics libraries read
 * `getPackageInfo(…).versionName`. Every one of those goes out under JCode's uid to a package
 * manager that has never heard of the guest, and comes back `NameNotFoundException`.
 *
 * Measured on NewPipe before this existed:
 * ```
 * androidx.startup.StartupException: PackageManager$NameNotFoundException:
 *     ComponentInfo{org.newpipex/androidx.startup.InitializationProvider}
 *     at androidx.startup.AppInitializer.discoverAndInitialize(AppInitializer.java:208)
 * ```
 * — the provider was hosted and running, and still could not read the metadata that says what to
 * initialise.
 *
 * ### Why the binder rather than the `PackageManager`
 *
 * `PackageManager` is an abstract class with a couple of hundred abstract members, so a wrapper that
 * delegates the rest is not a thing that can be written by hand. `IPackageManager` is an *interface*,
 * which is exactly what [Proxy] needs, and it sits underneath every `ApplicationPackageManager`
 * method — so one proxy covers every entry point at once. It is the same shape as the
 * `IActivityTaskManager` hook in [GuestHooks], for the same reason.
 *
 * Only queries naming a loaded guest are answered here; everything else is passed straight through,
 * so JCode's own package manager behaves exactly as it did. And like every other hook, this one is
 * guarded end to end: a platform that puts `sPackageManager` out of reach loses guest package
 * queries and nothing else.
