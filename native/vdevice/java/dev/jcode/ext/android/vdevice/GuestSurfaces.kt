/**
 * Makes a guest's own `SurfaceView` visible inside the tab.
 *
 * A `SurfaceView` does not paint. Its pixels live in a separate `SurfaceControl` which, by default,
 * sits **below** the window, and what makes it visible on a phone is the window punching a
 * transparent hole where the view is. A windowless `SurfaceControlViewHost` does not honour that
 * hole, so the guest's own opaque window background is drawn straight over the surface and the app
 * renders solid black while behaving perfectly correctly in every other respect.
 *
 * Measured on ES-DE: `org.libsdl.app.SDLSurface` present, focused, correctly sized at
 * `[0,50][1080,1560]`, SDL initialised and reading the device's identity — and nothing on screen.
 * That is the whole SDL / Unity / emulator-frontend family, which is a large share of what anyone
 * would want to try on a device like this.
 *
 * `setZOrderOnTop` moves the surface above the window instead, where nothing can paint over it.
 *
 * ### Why only the full-bleed ones
 *
 * Raising *every* `SurfaceView` would be wrong. A video player puts one behind its controls on
 * purpose, and lifting it above the window would hide the controls — trading a black screen for an
 * unusable one. So only a surface that already covers essentially the whole guest is raised, which
 * is exactly the case where there is nothing meant to be drawn over it, and exactly the case that is
 * black today.
 *
 * The cost, stated plainly: a raised surface is above *everything* in the host's own layer, so it
 * covers the device's status bar too — the same thing a full-screen game does to a phone's.

     * invisible, which is the worst of the three possible outcomes.

     * Lowering rather than trying to out-rank it is the honest fix. The guest's own window
     * background then covers the surface, which is what a phone shows too when a picker opens over
     * a game: the game is not on the screen any more.
