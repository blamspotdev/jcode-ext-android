/**
 * The guest's non-activity components, hosted in `:guest`.
 *
 * The container cannot register a guest's providers, services or receivers with the system: they
 * belong to a package the real `PackageManager` has never heard of, and every registration path ends
 * at a binder call that checks exactly that. What it *can* do is what `ActivityThread` does inside an
 * app process — build the objects, attach them to a [GuestContext], and drive their lifecycle by hand
 * — so that code which only ever talks to its own components sees them working.
 *
 * **This is in-process only, and that is the boundary.** Nothing here is reachable from outside
 * `:guest`: another app cannot query a hosted provider, no system broadcast arrives on its own, and
 * a service gets no process of its own to be restarted in. What it buys is the far more common case
 * of an app talking to itself — which is where the frameworks live.
 *
 * The one that matters most is `androidx.startup.InitializationProvider`. WorkManager, Firebase,
 * `emoji2`, ProfileInstaller and Coil all boot from it, and with no provider hosting at all a guest
 * that merely *depends* on WorkManager dies before its first frame with "WorkManager is not
 * initialized properly". Measured on NewPipe.
