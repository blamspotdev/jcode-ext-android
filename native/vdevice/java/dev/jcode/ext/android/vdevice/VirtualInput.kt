/**
 * `adb shell input` for JCode's virtual device.
 *
 * The tab already relays real `MotionEvent`s and `KeyEvent`s to the guest, so driving the device
 * from a terminal is a matter of *making* the right events rather than finding a way in: these are
 * built exactly as a touchscreen's would be — real down/move/up streams sharing one down time, a
 * `SOURCE_TOUCHSCREEN` device — and handed to the same [AppSandboxSession] calls a finger goes
 * through. An app cannot tell the two apart, which is the point: what an agent verifies this way is
 * what a person would see.
 *
 * Coordinates are the device's screen, the same ones `screencap` and `uiautomator dump` report.

     * The same gesture, measured from the **device's** screen instead of the phone's.
     *
     * A `MotionEvent` carries two positions: `getX`/`getY`, which every `ViewGroup` shifts on the way
     * down the tree, and `getRawX`/`getRawY`, which nothing shifts because they are where the finger
     * landed on the *display*. Relaying an event into the tab leaves the second one alone — so a guest
     * that reads it is told the tab's offset down JCode's window, and the device's screen appears to
     * start a couple of hundred pixels above the top of itself.
     *
     * That is not a corner case. It is what GameActivity hands native code
     * (`GameActivityPointerAxes.rawX`), what SDL reads, and what any app doing its own hit-testing
     * against a full-bleed surface uses — all of them correct on a phone, where a full-screen window
     * starts at the origin and the two positions are the same number. Measured on WaveRepo: every tap
     * arrived 258 px below the control it was aimed at, so the app rendered perfectly and answered
     * nothing. Nothing in the log said so, because from the app's side nothing went wrong.
     *
     * So the event is rebuilt from its **local** coordinates, which makes them its raw ones too: the
     * device's screen is the guest's window, exactly as a phone's screen is a full-screen app's. The
     * batched samples come with it — a velocity tracker with one sample per event fits no curve, and
     * flings would die.
     *
     * Returns the event itself when the two already agree, which is every event
     * [VirtualInput] synthesises and every one a full-screen guest gets.
