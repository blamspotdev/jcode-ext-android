/**
 * One guest app rendered into an editor tab, living in the `:guest` process.
 *
 * [SurfaceControlViewHost] is what makes this permission-free: it exists to let one process's views
 * be composited inside another's, the IDE and `:guest` share a uid, and — unlike an activity on a
 * virtual display — it asks nothing of the activity task manager. The guest's activity is built
 * window-less by [GuestRuntime.embed] and only its decor view is handed over.
 *
 * `hostToken` is the IDE `SurfaceView`'s own input token, and it is not optional:
 * `WindowlessWindowManager` asks the window manager to grant the embedded hierarchy an input
 * channel parented to it, and on Android 13 that call fails outright without one — taking the whole
 * host down with it on the next traversal.
 *
 * Having the channel is still not the same as being fed by it. Measured on Android 13: touches over
 * the tab are dispatched to JCode's window, not to the embedded one, so every event is relayed
 * over Binder from the IDE and dispatched straight into [container]. That is safe rather than
 * doubled — the IDE only ever sees an event the dispatcher did *not* give to the guest — but it does
 * cost the soft keyboard, which is why text arrives here as synthesised key events.
 *
 * Relaying is also why input has to pick its own target: a dialog or a popup is a *separate* window
 * with its own view root, not a child of [container], so [EmbeddedWindows] is asked which window is
 * on top and the event is translated into it.
