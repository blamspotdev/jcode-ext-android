/**
 * The virtual device's own colours, in one place.
 *
 * The device draws itself out of two halves that cannot share code. The container draws its wallpaper,
 * its launcher, its status bar and its permission prompt; its **apps** — Settings, Camera, Files, the
 * browser, the keyboard — are separate APKs in their own class loaders, built by plain `javac`
 * without so much as a shared library. Each of those carries a `Ui` class with these same values
 * written down again, which is the one duplication in the device that cannot be removed.
 *
 * What can be removed is the container having three of its own. The status bar, the wallpaper and the
 * prompt each grew a private set of near-misses — `#12141A`, `#2B2D31`, `#151B24`, three greys nobody
 * chose to be different — so a device that is meant to read as one machine had a home screen, a bar
 * and a dialog from three. These are the values the device's apps use, so the container now agrees
 * with them rather than approximating them.
 *
 * Dark rather than theme-aware, and that is deliberate: this is the *device's* look, not JCode's. A
 * phone does not change what its wallpaper is because the laptop next to it went light.
