/**
 * Makes an embedded guest a **windowed** app rather than a full-screen one that happens to be drawn
 * small.
 *
 * The tab is a window the size of a tab, and until this ran a guest inside it was told otherwise:
 * its `Resources` were built from JCode's configuration, so `screenWidthDp`, `orientation` and
 * every `-sw600dp`/`-land` resource qualifier described **the whole phone**, while the surface it
 * actually drew into was the editor pane. An app that trusts that — and a layout system is nothing
 * but an app that trusts that — lays itself out for a screen it does not have.
 *
 * Two things are needed, and they are needed together:
 *
 * 1. **A configuration that matches the surface.** [applySize] rewrites the guest's own
 *    `Configuration` and `DisplayMetrics` to the tab's real size, so measurement, resource
 *    qualifiers and anything reading `LocalConfiguration` agree with where the pixels go.
 * 2. **Permission to be that size.** [makeResizable] sets the activity's `resizeMode` and
 *    `FLAG_RESIZEABLE_FOR_SCREENS`, and drops any fixed `screenOrientation`. An activity that
 *    declares `resizeableActivity="false"` or pins itself to portrait is telling the framework it
 *    cannot cope with an arbitrary window — which in the tab is the only kind on offer, so the
 *    declaration has to go rather than be honoured.
 *
 * Neither reaches for a hidden member that is not already in [HiddenApi]'s ledger:
 * `Resources.updateConfiguration` and `ActivityInfo.screenOrientation` are public SDK, and
 * `resizeMode` is greylisted and guarded.
