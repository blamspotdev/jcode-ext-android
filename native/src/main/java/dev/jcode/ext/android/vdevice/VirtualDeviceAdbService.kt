/**
 * The adb services JCode's virtual device answers: everything an adb client asks of a device is
 * served out of the [VirtualDevice] container, and nothing is ever forwarded to the host phone.
 *
 * The shape of the surface is deliberate. Between `install`, `am start`, `input`, `uiautomator dump`
 * and `screencap`, an agent with nothing but a terminal can put an app on the device, drive it, read
 * what is on screen and take it off again — the same loop a person has through the tab, over a
 * protocol that was already there. Everything else answers [unsupportedService] on one line rather
 * than hanging or pretending to have worked.
 *
 * Commands answer on `shell:` and on `exec:` alike, and the reply is bytes rather than text, so
 * `adb exec-out screencap -p > shot.png` returns a PNG intact. Nothing here allocates a PTY — that
 * is the line discipline which would otherwise rewrite every `\n` in it into `\r\n`.
 *
 * "Installing" here means staging the APK under the container's own storage; there is no system
 * package database involved, so a guest is still invisible to the real `pm` — and
 * [VirtualDeviceApps] empties the whole tree on every JCode start.
