/**
 * Dialogs, popup menus and drop-downs inside an embedded guest.
 *
 * A `SurfaceControlViewHost` already owns a `WindowlessWindowManager`, and `WindowManagerGlobal`
 * will route a window into it — no permission and no real activity token involved — as long as the
 * window's `LayoutParams.token` is the host's own window token. That token is [token]: `Dialog`
 * takes it from the activity window's app token, which [GuestHooks.hostWindowIn] sets, while
 * `PopupWindow`, `Spinner` drop-downs and option menus already read it off their anchor view.
 *
 * What the windowless session does *not* do is lay a window out. It answers every relayout with
 * `frame = (0, 0, attrs.width, attrs.height)` and never moves the surface, so a WRAP_CONTENT
 * window — which every dialog and every popup is — comes back with a -2x-2 frame, is given a 1x1
 * surface, draws nothing, and would sit in the tab's top-left corner if it did. [install] wraps the
 * host's `IWindowSession` to do the two things a real window manager would: resolve
 * WRAP_CONTENT/MATCH_PARENT against the tab, and place the window's surface by its gravity.
 *
 * All of this reflection is on greylisted members (`ViewRootImpl.mAttachInfo`,
 * `ViewRootImpl.mWindowSession`, `WindowManagerGlobal.mViews`/`mParams`), and every step is
 * guarded: [install] answering null leaves the guest exactly as it was before, refusing dialogs
 * outright rather than showing them wrong.
