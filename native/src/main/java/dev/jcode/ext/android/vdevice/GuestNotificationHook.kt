/**
 * The virtual device's notification service: keeps a guest's notifications on the device instead of
 * in the user's own shade.
 *
 * Without this a guest's `notify()` goes out over binder under **JCode's** uid and package, so it
 * lands in the phone's real notification shade, attributed to JCode, and survives the device being
 * emptied. That is the one thing the virtual device exists to avoid — an app should be triable
 * without leaving anything behind on the phone.
 *
 * `INotificationManager` is an interface, so the same [Proxy] shape as the other hooks works:
 * posting and cancelling are answered into [VirtualNotifications] and never reach the system, while
 * everything the guest merely *asks* — whether notifications are enabled, what channels exist — is
 * answered as a permissive yes so the guest goes on to post rather than giving up early.
 *
 * Calls the container does not model still go through to the real service, because most of them are
 * harmless reads and a notification manager that throws is worse than one that over-answers.
