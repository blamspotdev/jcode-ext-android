/**
 * A path the device can be walked along, instead of the straight line between two typed points.
 *
 * ### These are sketches, and that is deliberate
 *
 * Every trail here is **hand-drawn, simplified and displaced**. A dozen or two points stand in for a
 * road that has hundreds; the whole shape is shifted a few hundred metres from where the real one
 * is; and [headingSkew] puts the reported compass a few degrees off the true bearing of travel.
 *
 * The reason is not subtlety. A tool that replays a faithful GPS trace of a real street, at a
 * realistic speed, with a matching compass, is a tool for making a fake journey look like a real one
 * — and that is worth nothing to the person testing a maps app and quite a lot to somebody
 * fabricating a delivery, a run, or an alibi. So the repository simply does not contain a faithful
 * trace to replay: the offsets are written down below rather than hidden, because the protection is
 * that there is no accurate data underneath them, not that the numbers are a secret.
 *
 * The outer guarantee is stronger still and belongs to the device rather than to this file: a
 * simulated fix is only ever answered to a guest inside JCode's virtual device. It does not mock
 * the phone's own location, no app outside the IDE can see it, and it is wiped on every restart.
 *
 * What survives the alteration is everything a developer actually needs — a plausible speed, a
 * plausible shape, and the heading changes each kind of road produces.
