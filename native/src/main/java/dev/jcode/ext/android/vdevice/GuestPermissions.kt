/**
 * How a guest's permissions are answered, now that the device has an opinion about them.
 *
 * A guest holds JCode's permissions and no others, which used to make every permission question a
 * question about the *IDE* — and the container answered `checkPermission` with a flat
 * `PERMISSION_GRANTED` so that libraries expecting a straight answer got one. That was fine while
 * there was nothing to decide. It is not fine now that a person can hand one app the microphone and
 * refuse it to the next.
 *
 * So the device answers the way a phone does, out of two settings that are deliberately separate:
 *
 *  - **What the app may do**, per permission it declares in its own manifest: allow, deny, or ask.
 *    Managed per app in Manage permissions.
 *  - **What the device has**, per piece of hardware: off, simulated, or the phone's. Managed once
 *    for the whole device on the hardware bench.
 *
 * They are *both* required. An app cannot be given a camera the device does not have, and a device
 * with a camera does not hand it to an app that was refused one. Everything a phone would answer
 * without asking anybody — a permission the app never declared — is denied, which is the same answer
 * the platform gives and the one every caller is written to handle.
 *
 * ### The request nobody could answer
 *
 * `requestPermissions` was broken outright before any of this. An app that called it built an intent
 * for the permission controller, which went out to the real system, which was being asked to grant a
 * permission to **JCode** — a package that does not declare most of them — and the result came back
 * addressed to an activity token no `ActivityRecord` answers to. So the dialog never appeared, the
 * callback never arrived, and an app that waits for one before doing anything simply stopped there.
 *
 * [consume] takes that launch off the wire. What is already decided is answered from the policy;
 * what is still [PermissionRule.Ask] is put to the person at the keyboard, through the device's own
 * prompt, and their answer is written down so the same question is not asked twice.
