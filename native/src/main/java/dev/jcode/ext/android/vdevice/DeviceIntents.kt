/**
 * What the virtual device's own apps answer, and how an implicit intent finds them.
 *
 * ### Why this is a table and not intent-filter matching
 *
 * An implicit intent is resolved by matching it against every installed app's `<intent-filter>`s,
 * and that is not something this container can do: `PackageManager` does not report the filters in
 * an APK it has not installed. `getPackageArchiveInfo` gives activities, permissions and features —
 * everything except the one thing resolution needs. Reading them would mean parsing binary
 * `AndroidManifest.xml` in the container, which is a real parser to write and keep correct against
 * a format nobody documents.
 *
 * What is actually needed is narrower. **The apps that have to answer implicit intents are the
 * device's own**, because they are the ones an app expects a device to have: something to take a
 * photo, something to pick a file, something to open a link. A phone's answer to
 * `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE` is its system camera, and this device's is its system camera. Those are
 * shipped in the container's own assets, so what they answer is known here rather than discovered —
 * and a table that says so plainly is more honest than a parser that rediscovers it every start.
 *
 * A guest answering *another guest's* implicit intent is deliberately not supported. It would need
 * the parser, and nothing has yet wanted it: two sideloaded apps that expect to find each other are
 * not what this device is for.
