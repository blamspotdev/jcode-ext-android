/**
 * How an answer gets back from one screen of the virtual device to the screen that asked for it.
 *
 * `startActivityForResult` is half of a contract, and until now the device only had the half that
 * goes out. An embedded activity could start another one — that has worked since the container grew
 * a back stack — but nothing ever came back, because the platform's return path runs through an
 * `ActivityRecord` and these activities have none. Every result the device produced was therefore
 * produced by the *container*, for the two intents it answered itself.
 *
 * That is what stopped the device having a camera app rather than a camera *screen*. An app asks for
 * a photo by starting somebody else's activity and waiting; if no answer can come back, the only way
 * to answer at all is for the container to impersonate the app that should have. With this, the
 * device's own Camera and Files are ordinary apps: they are started like any other, they call
 * `setResult` like any other, and the requester's `onActivityResult` runs.
 *
 * ### Two reflective steps, and only the second one is delicate
 *
 * **Reading** the finished activity's answer is `mResultCode`/`mResultData` — private fields of
 * `Activity` with no SDK equivalent, since `setResult` has no getter. **Delivering** it is
 * `onActivityResult`, which is `protected` SDK API that no hidden-API policy applies to, and
 * reflection dispatches virtually — so an app's own override runs, and AndroidX's `ComponentActivity`
 * override forwards into `ActivityResultRegistry`, where a `registerForActivityResult` launcher is
 * waiting. Both the old callback and the modern contract are answered by it.
