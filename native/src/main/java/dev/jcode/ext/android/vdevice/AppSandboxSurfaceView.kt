 * ([SurfaceView.setChildSurfacePackage]). It also has to be hardware accelerated, which JCode's
 * window is not by default — the page checks that before offering to run anything in the tab.
 *
 * It lives as long as the tab does, with or without a guest: it is what gives the device its
 * resolution and the host token a guest is embedded under.
 *
 * Input is forwarded by hand. The embedded hierarchy is registered with no host input token, so the
 * system delivers it nothing; the events that arrive here are already in this view's coordinates,
 * which are the guest's, so they can be relayed unchanged.
