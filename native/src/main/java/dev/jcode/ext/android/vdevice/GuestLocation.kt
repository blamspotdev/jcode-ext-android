/**
 * The device's own GPS: a fix the user typed, reported to a guest as though a receiver had produced
 * it.
 *
 * There is no passthrough mode here and there never will be. A guest is somebody else's APK running
 * inside the IDE, under JCode's uid, and the single most valuable thing it could steal is where the
 * user is standing. So the phone's real location is not one of the choices — the device either has
 * no location hardware at all, or it has one that always says the same thing.
 *
 * ### Where the seam is, and where it is not
 *
 * `LocationManager` is final, so it cannot be subclassed the way [GuestSensorManager] subclasses
 * `SensorManager`. It is a thin client over one binder, so the obvious move is to replace that
 * binder — but the field holding it, `LocationManager.mService`, is **blocked** at `targetSdk` 33.
 * Measured on Android 13 from inside a guest: `LocationManager.class.getDeclaredFields()` answers
 * with the public `String` constants and *nothing else*, which is what a denied member looks like
 * from here. So there is no instance to patch.
 *
 * What is reachable is the step before the instance exists. `SystemServiceRegistry` builds the one
 * `LocationManager` each `ContextImpl` gets by asking `ServiceManager.getService("location")` and
 * wrapping the result with `ILocationManager.Stub.asInterface` — and `ServiceManager.sCache` is
 * consulted first, is greylisted, and is writable. A local `Binder` carrying our own
 * `ILocationManager` as its interface put there before any guest starts means every location
 * manager built in this process afterwards is a genuine, complete client object that happens to be
 * talking to us. `asInterface` hands back the local object rather than a binder proxy, so not one
 * call leaves the process.
 *
 * The handler **never delegates**. An unmodelled method answers with nothing rather than falling
 * through to the real location service, because falling through is precisely the failure this
 * guards against: one forgotten method is one route to the user's coordinates. Nothing is lost by
 * it — the honest answer for a device with no receiver *is* nothing.
