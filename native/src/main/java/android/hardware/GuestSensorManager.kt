/**
 * The `SensorManager` a guest on JCode's virtual device is handed instead of the phone's.
 *
 * Motion sensors are the one piece of hardware Android has never put behind a permission: any app
 * may read the accelerometer, the magnetometer and the gyroscope without asking anybody. That is
 * fine on a phone, where the app is one the user chose to install. It is not fine here, where the
 * app is somebody else's build being run inside an IDE — and until this class existed there was no
 * way to say no, because the container handed guests the host's own manager and every guest could
 * feel the user's hand.
 *
 * So each of the three families in `VirtualHardware` is resolved per app, at the moment it is asked
 * for:
 *
 *  - **Off** — the sensor is not in the list, and a registration for one is refused. An app that
 *    checks properly finds the device has no such hardware.
 *  - **Real** — the phone's, forwarded through a listener of our own so that turning it off later
 *    actually stops the stream rather than leaving it running until the app unregisters.
 *  - **Simulated** — the device's own: it is lying flat, face up, pointing north, and not moving.
 *    Delivered on a ticker at the rate the app asked for.
 *
 * Everything else the phone has — light, proximity, pressure, heart rate — is passed through
 * untouched. This manager governs what the device claims as *its* hardware, and inventing a policy
 * for the rest would be a larger claim than the one being made.
 *
 * ### Why this class is in `android.hardware`
 *
 * Not for access to anything private. `SensorManager`'s constructor is **package-private in the SDK
 * stub** — metalava writes one for every abstract class an app is not meant to subclass — while the
 * class the runtime actually loads has the ordinary public default constructor of a public class. So
 * the restriction is a compile-time one and only a compile-time one, and sharing the package is what
 * satisfies it. Nothing here reaches for a member the platform hides; see below for what does.
 *
 * ### Why the overrides carry no `override`
 *
 * Every abstract member of `SensorManager` is `@hide`, so none of them is in the stub this compiles
 * against and none of them can be written with `override` — the compiler would be overriding
 * something it cannot see. They are declared as ordinary methods with the same name and descriptor,
 * which is what the runtime matches on when it links the vtable, so the platform's concrete
 * `getSensorList`, `getDefaultSensor` and `registerListener` land on them.
 *
 * A member this misses stays abstract and would throw `AbstractMethodError` if a guest reached it.
 * That is why the class is *proved* before a guest is given one — `GuestSensors.forGuest` calls
 * through it once and falls back to the phone's manager if anything at all goes wrong, so a platform
 * that changes any of this costs the device its sensor policy and nothing else.
