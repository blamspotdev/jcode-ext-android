# vdevice-browser

The virtual device's **built-in browser** — an address bar, a page, and Back.

It exists so the device has a way to open a URL without reaching for the phone's browser, which
would take the user out of JCode and load the page under their own profile: their cookies, their
signed-in accounts. Inside the device, everything it loads is wiped with the device.

Resource-free is a *packaging* constraint, not a licence to look unfinished: with no `res/` there is
no theme, no drawable and no dimension to inherit, so every surface is built in code instead. The
chrome is the device's own palette — a rounded address pill, glyph buttons for back, forward and
reload that dim when they would do nothing, a two-pixel progress line, a hairline instead of a raised
bar — and a failed load gets a page of ours rather than the platform's white one, which reads as a
crash on a surface this dark. The address shows the **host** while a page is loaded and the whole URL
(selected, ready to replace) while it is being edited.

It is an **ordinary guest**. No container privileges, no special casing — JCode installs it onto the
device on every start like any other APK, and it goes through the same load, embed, window and
WebView paths every other app takes. That makes it a live test of those paths as much as a feature.

## Where it ends up

The signed APK goes over the bundled copy under `native/vdevice/assets/vdevice/`, which is what
the pack ships and what every device is built from. The `Copy-Item` closing the build below is that
step. Source and artifact are both in this repository; they were split across two until the sources
moved here.

`VirtualDeviceApps.installBuiltIns` reinstalls it after every wipe, because a built-in is not exempt
from the clean room — it is put back into it.

## Notes on the manifest

- **`Theme.DeviceDefault.NoActionBar`** — the address bar is this app's chrome. The platform default
  for `targetSdk` 33 would add an empty dark action bar above it, a second useless header between
  the device's status bar and the only control the browser has.
- **A framework icon** (`@android:drawable/ic_menu_search`) rather than one of its own, so this stays
  a single-dex, resource-free APK that plain `javac` + `d8` + `aapt2` can build.
- `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` are declared, but a guest inherits JCode's permissions
  regardless — they are there so the manifest is honest about what it needs.

## Build

From this directory, with a JDK 17+ on PATH:

```powershell
$sdk = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk"; $jar = "$sdk\platforms\android-33\android.jar"; $bt = "$sdk\build-tools\37.0.0"
javac -source 11 -target 11 -encoding UTF-8 -nowarn -cp $jar -d out (Get-ChildItem src -Recurse -Filter *.java | % FullName)
& "$bt\d8.bat" --min-api 24 --lib $jar --output out (Get-ChildItem out -Recurse -Filter *.class | % FullName)
& "$bt\aapt2.exe" link -o base.apk --manifest AndroidManifest.xml -I $jar --min-sdk-version 24 --target-sdk-version 33
Push-Location out; jar uf ..\base.apk classes.dex; Pop-Location
& "$bt\zipalign.exe" -f 4 base.apk aligned.apk
& "$bt\apksigner.bat" sign --ks "$env:USERPROFILE\.android\debug.keystore" --ks-pass pass:android --key-pass pass:android --ks-key-alias androiddebugkey --out browser.apk aligned.apk
Copy-Item browser.apk ..\..\native\vdevice\assets\vdevice\browser.apk -Force
```

The copy is the step that matters — the asset is what ships.
