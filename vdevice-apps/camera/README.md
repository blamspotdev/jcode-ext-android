# vdevice-camera

The virtual device's camera app. Built into every device, like the browser and Files.

An app that wants a photo starts `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE` and waits, and the careful ones call
`resolveActivity` first and hide their camera button when nothing answers. The container used to draw
a viewfinder itself, which worked and was still the wrong shape: a drawn screen is not something
`PackageManager` can find, so an app that asks before it reaches never got as far as reaching.

This is an **ordinary guest**. No container privileges and no Camera2 — the picture is drawn from the
device's own motion sensors, which is something any app may read, and saved with ordinary file IO.
That is deliberate: the app that proves the device has a camera should not be the one app that needs
special help to run. It is also a live check on the simulated sensors, and it earned its keep on the
first run — see below.

## What it does

| Started by | What happens |
|---|---|
| The launcher | Viewfinder and a shutter; photos go to the device's `DCIM/Camera` |
| `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE` | The same, and answers the caller |
| `ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE` | Records three seconds to an MP4 and answers with its URI |

The capture contract is honoured as written: with `EXTRA_OUTPUT` the full-size JPEG is written to
that URI and the result carries no data; without it the result carries a thumbnail under the `"data"`
extra. Either way the full-size file is kept in `DCIM/Camera`, because the picture somebody just took
should be somewhere they can find it — and here that is a path `adb pull` takes.

## What it sees

Chosen on JCode's hardware bench and read through the container's settings provider. **Pixel art by
default** — five frames on a one-second loop — with a three-still slideshow and a single still as the
other options.

It used to draw its scene procedurally on every frame: colour bars, a horizon computed from the
attitude, a compass rose and a line of readouts. That made the camera the most expensive thing on an
otherwise idle device, to show numbers nobody reads off a viewfinder. Frames are rendered once into
48x36 bitmaps and blitted with filtering off, which is what makes them pixel art rather than blurred
small pictures.

Measured with the viewfinder open, over 20 seconds: **3.6%** of a core for the pixel art, **0.2%**
for a still, against **11.5-18.5%** for the procedural scene.

Still drawn to look drawn: nothing here could be mistaken for a photograph of a room, which is what a
camera quietly handing over *something* would invite.

## What it looks like

A camera is mostly viewfinder, so the chrome is four tones and a shape: a near-black bar, a leave
button as a pill on the left, and a **round shutter** in the middle — a white ring with a filled
centre, or a red square when the caller asked for video. It was a text button reading "Take photo",
which is the one control on a camera nobody needs told about being the one thing that was spelled
out. Everything is a `GradientDrawable` built in code and sized from `dp`, so it needs no resources
beyond the launcher icon.

The screen for *no camera* or *permission refused* is a card on a surface rather than text on black:
a message should read as a message, and black-with-text reads as a camera that has broken.

## Four things it found

- **The simulated compass was mirrored.** With the bench at 45° the viewfinder read 315°.
  `SimulatedHardware.rotation` built its heading matrix with the sign that makes
  `getRotationMatrix` + `getOrientation` — the way every app reads a heading — return −a. Nothing had
  caught it: gravity is unaffected by that sign, so the accelerometer values that were checked
  exactly stayed correct, and the bench's own readout reports the azimuth it was given rather than
  deriving it. The two had quietly disagreed since the bench was written.
- **A permission request from `onCreate` goes nowhere.** The device's dialog is raised on behalf of
  whichever activity is in front, and an embedded activity is not in front until it has been resumed
  — so the request could not be addressed to anybody and vanished, leaving this app on "Waiting for
  permission" with nothing in the device's log. It asks from `onResume` instead.
- **Hardware answers were frozen for the life of the guest process.** Switch the camera on at the
  bench with a device already running and this app still said *This device has no camera* — not
  because the container answered wrongly (it answered `true`) but because
  `ApplicationPackageManager` caches `hasSystemFeature` in a `PropertyInvalidatedCache` in front of
  it, shared by the whole process and invalidated only by a system property the system server owns.
  At `targetSdk` 33 that class exposes **no member at all** to reflection, so there is nothing to
  clear. The device restarts on a bench change now, which is the truthful version of the same event.
  This is what "the camera won't work or won't ask for permission" turned out to be.
- **`active` was never put back.** The container attributes permission checks to the guest in front,
  and that was set when an activity *started* and never restored when it finished. Harmless while
  the only cross-app launch was fire-and-forget; once an app could start this one and be returned to,
  the caller's own checks were answered from **this app's** grants — measured: the hardware fixture
  read `CAMERA = GRANTED` right after the Camera was allowed it.

## Build

Plain `javac` + `d8` + `aapt2`, like the other fixtures — no Gradle project. There **is** a `res/`
directory now, for the launcher icon: `aapt2` compiles one on its own, which is worth knowing,
because "these apps have no resources" had quietly turned from a packaging constraint into a reason
they looked unfinished.

```powershell
& "$btapt2.exe" compile --dir res -o res.zip
```

then pass `res.zip --java gen` to `aapt2 link` and compile `gen\**\R.java` alongside `src`.

```powershell
$sdk = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk"; $jar = "$sdk\platforms\android-33\android.jar"; $bt = "$sdk\build-tools\37.0.0"
javac -source 11 -target 11 -encoding UTF-8 -nowarn -cp $jar -d out (Get-ChildItem src -Recurse -Filter *.java | % FullName)
& "$bt\d8.bat" --min-api 24 --lib $jar --output out (Get-ChildItem out -Recurse -Filter *.class | % FullName)
& "$bt\aapt2.exe" link -o base.apk --manifest AndroidManifest.xml -I $jar --min-sdk-version 24 --target-sdk-version 33
Push-Location out; jar uf ..\base.apk classes.dex; Pop-Location
& "$bt\zipalign.exe" -f 4 base.apk aligned.apk
& "$bt\apksigner.bat" sign --ks "$env:USERPROFILE\.android\debug.keystore" --ks-pass pass:android --key-pass pass:android --ks-key-alias androiddebugkey --out camera.apk aligned.apk
```

Then copy it over the bundled copy, which is what every device is built from:

```powershell
Copy-Item camera.apk ..\..\native\vdevice\assets\vdevice\camera.apk
```
